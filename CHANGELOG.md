# Changelog

All notable changes to Secblitz. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

New work goes under **Unreleased**. `scripts/bump-version.py` moves that section into a
dated version section when a release is prepared (see `docs/RELEASING.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Details and dialogs show one line per point; open a point to read more.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added
- When Web protection stops a dangerous or scam site, a warning now appears over your browser with a way to go back or let it through once.

### Changed
- Web protection also blocks sites known for harmful downloads or for apps that secretly spy on people, as part of its dangerous sites choice.

### Removed
- App updates are gone from the Tools page. Windows updates and repair are unchanged.

### Fixed
- Removed apps say "yesterday" for an app removed before midnight, not "today".

## [0.11.1] - 2026-10-09

### Changed
- Each setting has one info button that opens a small window explaining it, instead of text that opens under the row.
- The Details button is gone, and the window never repeats a setting's status or the line on its row.

- Each setting on the Protection page shows at most one tag, and its sections run in one order: needs you, your choices, good to know, already protected.

- Check names and explanations describe each Windows setting and what it protects, in plain words.
- The tray alert for a drop in protection is shorter.
