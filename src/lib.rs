//! Secblitz engine: Windows hardening checks, fixes and undo, plus the update, service and diagnostics support the GUI and CLI build on.
//!
//! The library holds logic that depends on neither the GUI nor the command line: checks, fixes and undo, plain-language advice and explanations, user settings, updates and the background service. The binary crate (`main.rs`) holds the GUI, the command line, the launcher and the admin helper.
