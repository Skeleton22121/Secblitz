# Report translation source keys

Each line below is an exact English `Lang::t` source key (and fallback content). Translate full sentences, not tokens. `src/advice.rs` returns these keys; `src/ui.rs` translates them at rendering time. Do not translate IDs, status input tokens, or the exact backend reason strings matched by advice. Existing keys may already be present. The i18n agent owns catalog additions; this change does not edit `src/i18n.rs`.

## Impact phrases

Each phrase is a noun phrase naming the concrete threat a check guards against, translated as a standalone key. They are used in `src/advice.rs` via `control_impact()` and `finding_impact()`, and rendered via `impact_line()` in `src/ui.rs`. Empty impact means no impact line is shown.

### Prefix keys

### Control impact phrases

```text
A full drive stopping fixes and updates from completing
Malware running as soon as it lands on your PC

Strangers on the network listing your account names to guess passwords
Someone signing in over the network to an account with no password

```

### Finding impact phrases

```text
Running Windows that no longer gets security fixes
Strangers reading your files if your PC is lost or stolen
Hidden malware loading before Windows starts
Known security holes staying open on your PC
Attackers trying to sign in to your PC remotely
Old file-sharing flaws used by worms like WannaCry

## Design notes

**Borders**: All CLI table and card borders use rounded corners (`╭╮╰╯`). Internal borders use `─│┬┴┼├┤`.

**Status chips**: The status cell in the wide table is prefixed with a glyph: `✓ Good to go` (green), `! Can fix` (yellow), `↻ Restart needed` (yellow), `? Couldn't check` (dim), `• For your information` (dim). Colour is derived from the glyph character.

**Group headings**: Each group heading in both the CLI report and the TUI report text carries an icon and count. CLI: `! Recommended fixes (N)`. TUI: `▸ Recommended fixes (N)`.

**Totals line**: `! Recommended fixes: N · ✓ Protected: N · ? Needs your choice: N`.

## Integration note

The catalog-coverage test validates that all impact phrases and prefix keys are in the TEXT/ITALIAN catalogs, and that they are translated in all six languages. The test `advice_impact_keys_are_translated_in_all_six_languages` in `src/i18n.rs` enumerates control and finding impact keys. Preserve qualified language such as “may”, “this check”, and “before”: absent settings, unknown health, and audit-only findings are intentionally not reported as confirmed protection or automatic repairs.
